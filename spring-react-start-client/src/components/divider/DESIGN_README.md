*Symbol Path: general -> Divider*

## Purpose

Dividers are used to visually separate content on a page.

## Appropriate Uses

- To visually provide a break in content sets, letting the user know the content and actions below are not related to content above.

## User Interactions

- A divider should not contain any interactions.

## Usage Tips & Best Practices

- Use the text divider to separate 2 options to complete a task such as Login OR Register.
- The UI Kit provides variations in spacing below the dividers to create more/less separation.
- Dividers can be full width to the edge of the browser or have side margins.
- Some components have bottom borders and do not need the divider component to separate them.

## Accessibility
- Dividers are often light in color, ensure this is high enough in contrast to pass accessible guides.
